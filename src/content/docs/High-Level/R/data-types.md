Numeric data types in R represent numbers with decimal points. They can be either integers or floating-point numbers. For example:



```r

x <- 10

y <- 3.14

```





Character data types in R represent strings of text. They are enclosed in single or double quotes. For example:



```r

name <- "John Doe"

```





Logical data types in R represent boolean values, which can be either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. For example:



```r

is_admin <- TRUE

```





Integer data types in R represent whole numbers. They are created by adding an `L` suffix to the number. For example:



```r

count <- 100L

```





Complex data types in R represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts. They are created using the `complex()` function. For example:



```r

z <- complex(real = 3, imaginary = 4)

```



These are some of the basic data types in R. Understanding them is essential for working with variables and performing computations in R.
