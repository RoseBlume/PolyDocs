JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. In R, you can work with JSON files using several packages, such as `jsonlite` and `rjson`.





To read JSON files in R, you can use the `fromJSON` function from the `jsonlite` package. First, you need to install and load the package:



```r

install.packages("jsonlite")

library(jsonlite)

```



Then, you can read a JSON file as follows:



```r

json_data <- fromJSON("path/to/your/file.json")



print(json_data)

```





Writing JSON files in R is just as straightforward. You can use the `toJSON` function from the `jsonlite` package:



```r

data <- list(name = "John", age = 30, city = "New York")



json_data <- toJSON(data, pretty = TRUE)



write(json_data, file = "path/to/your/output.json")

```





Working with JSON files in R is made easy with the `jsonlite` package. You can read JSON files using the `fromJSON` function and write JSON files using the `toJSON` function. This allows for seamless data interchange between R and other systems that use JSON.
