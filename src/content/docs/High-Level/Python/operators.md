Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations in Python. Here are the commonly used arithmetic operators:



- Addition: `+`

- Subtraction: `-`

- Multiplication: `*`

- Division: `/`

- Modulus: `%`

- Exponentiation: `**`

- Floor Division: `//`





```python

result = 5 + 3

print(result)  # Output: 8



result = 10 - 4

print(result)  # Output: 6



result = 2 * 6

print(result)  # Output: 12



result = 15 / 3

print(result)  # Output: 5.0



result = 17 % 5

print(result)  # Output: 2



result = 2 ** 3

print(result)  # Output: 8



result = 17 // 5

print(result)  # Output: 3

```



Remember to use parentheses to control the order of operations when necessary.
