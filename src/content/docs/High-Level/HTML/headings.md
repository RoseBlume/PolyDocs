In HTML, headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. Each heading tag represents a different level of importance, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` being the least important. Headings help to structure the content on a webpage, making it easier for users and search engines to understand the hierarchy and organization of the information.





- `<h1>`: This is the main heading of the page, typically used for the title or the most important heading.

- `<h2>`: This is used for subheadings under `<h1>`, representing the second level of importance.

- `<h3>`: This is used for subheadings under `<h2>`, representing the third level of importance.

- `<h4>`: This is used for subheadings under `<h3>`, representing the fourth level of importance.

- `<h5>`: This is used for subheadings under `<h4>`, representing the fifth level of importance.

- `<h6>`: This is used for subheadings under `<h5>`, representing the sixth level of importance.





Here is an example of how to use the different heading tags in HTML:



```html

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

    <title>HTML Headings Example</title>

</head>

<body>

    <h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>

    <h2>This is an h2 heading</h2>

    <h3>This is an h3 heading</h3>

    <h4>This is an h4 heading</h4>

    <h5>This is an h5 heading</h5>

    <h6>This is an h6 heading</h6>

</body>

</html>

```





The above code will render the following headings on a webpage:



<h1>This is an h1 heading</h1>

<h2>This is an h2 heading</h2>

<h3>This is an h3 heading</h3>

<h4>This is an h4 heading</h4>

<h5>This is an h5 heading</h5>

<h6>This is an h6 heading</h6>





Using headings correctly is important for several reasons:



1. **Accessibility**: Screen readers use headings to help users navigate the content.

2. **SEO**: Search engines use headings to understand the structure and relevance of the content.

3. **Readability**: Headings break up the text, making it easier for users to scan and find the information they need.



By using headings appropriately, you can create a well-structured and accessible webpage that is easy to navigate and understand.
