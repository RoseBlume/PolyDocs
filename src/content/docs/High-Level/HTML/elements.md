HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It consists of various elements that define the structure and content of a web page.





- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These tags define headings of different levels, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` being the lowest. Headings are important for SEO and accessibility as they help to structure the content and make it easier to navigate.



- `<p>`: This tag defines a paragraph of text. Paragraphs are block-level elements, meaning they start on a new line and take up the full width available.

- `<a>`: The anchor tag is used to create hyperlinks, which are clickable links that navigate to other web pages or resources. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the linked resource.

- `<span>`: This is an inline container element used to apply styles or manipulate text within a larger block of content. Unlike `<div>`, it does not start on a new line.



- `<img>`: This tag is used to embed images in a web page. It is a self-closing tag and requires the `src` attribute to specify the path to the image file, and the `alt` attribute to provide alternative text for accessibility.



- `<ul>`: Unordered list, which displays a list of items with bullet points.

- `<ol>`: Ordered list, which displays a list of items with numbers.

- `<li>`: List item, used within `<ul>` or `<ol>` to define individual list items.



- `<div>`: A generic block-level container element used to group other elements. It is often used with CSS to apply styles or JavaScript to manipulate sections of the page.



- `<table>`: This tag is used to create a table to display tabular data. It contains `<tr>` for table rows, `<th>` for table headers, and `<td>` for table data cells.



- `<form>`: This tag is used to create interactive forms for user input. It can contain various input elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, `<select>`, and `<label>`. The `action` attribute specifies where to send the form data when submitted, and the `method` attribute specifies the HTTP method to use (GET or POST).



- Always close HTML elements properly by using the closing tag (`</tagname>`), unless the element is self-closing (e.g., `<img>`).

- Use semantic HTML elements to improve the accessibility and SEO of your web pages.

- Validate your HTML code to ensure it follows the standards and is free of errors.
