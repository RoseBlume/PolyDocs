 To format text in HTML, you can use various elements. Here are some commonly used ones, along with their semantic meanings and usage examples:





The `<em>` element is used to emphasize text, which typically renders as italicized text. This element should be used to stress the importance of a word or phrase within a sentence. For example:

```html

<p>This is <em>emphasized</em> text.</p>

```



The `<i>` element is used to indicate text that is in an alternate voice or mood, such as a technical term, a phrase from another language, or a thought. It also renders as italicized text. For example:

```html

<p>This is <i>italicized</i> text.</p>

```





The `<small>` element is used to render text in a smaller font size, often for fine print or disclaimers. For example:

```html

<p>This is <small>smaller</small> text.</p>

```



The `<mark>` element is used to highlight or mark a specific portion of text, typically rendering with a yellow background. This is useful for drawing attention to important information. For example:

```html

<p>This is <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>

```





The `<del>` element is used to indicate deleted or removed text, which typically renders with a strikethrough effect. This can be useful for showing edits or changes in a document. For example:

```html

<p>This is <del>deleted</del> text.</p>

```



The `<ins>` element is used to indicate inserted or added text, which typically renders with an underline effect. This can be useful for showing additions in a document. For example:

```html

<p>This is <ins>inserted</ins> text.</p>

```





The `<strong>` element is used to indicate strong importance or seriousness, typically rendering as bold text. This element should be used to highlight critical information. For example:

```html

<p>This is <strong>strong</strong> text.</p>

```



The `<sub>` element is used to render text as subscript, which is positioned below the normal text line. This is often used in chemical formulas or mathematical expressions. For example:

```html

<p>This is <sub>subscript</sub> text.</p>

```



The `<sup>` element is used to render text as superscript, which is positioned above the normal text line. This is often used for footnotes, exponents, or ordinal indicators. For example:

```html

<p>This is <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p>

```



Remember to always use these elements semantically, based on their intended meaning, rather than just for visual styling. Proper use of these elements ensures that your HTML is accessible and meaningful to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
