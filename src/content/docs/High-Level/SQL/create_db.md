Creating a database in SQL is a fundamental task. Here, we will learn how to create a new database using SQL commands.





To create a database, you use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement. The basic syntax is:



```sql

CREATE DATABASE database_name;

```



Replace `database_name` with the name you want to give your database.





Let's create a database named `LibraryDB`:



```sql

CREATE DATABASE LibraryDB;

```



This command will create a new database named `LibraryDB` that you can use to store and manage your data.





To verify that the database has been created, you can use the `SHOW DATABASES` command:



```sql

SHOW DATABASES;

```



This will list all the databases available on your SQL server, and you should see `LibraryDB` in the list.





Creating a database is the first step in managing your data with SQL. With the `CREATE DATABASE` statement, you can easily set up a new database to start organizing your information.
