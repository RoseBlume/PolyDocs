In C++, comments are used to explain code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the compiler and do not affect the execution of the program. There are two types of comments in C++:





Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (`//`). Everything following `//` on that line is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler.



```cpp

// This is a single-line comment

int x = 5; // This is another single-line comment

```





Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`. Everything between these markers is considered a comment and is ignored by the compiler. Multi-line comments can span multiple lines.



```cpp

/* This is a multi-line comment

    that spans multiple lines */

int y = 10; /* This is another multi-line comment */

```





- Use comments to explain the purpose of the code, not the obvious.

- Keep comments concise and relevant.

- Update comments if the code changes to avoid outdated or misleading information.



By using comments effectively, you can make your code easier to understand and maintain.
