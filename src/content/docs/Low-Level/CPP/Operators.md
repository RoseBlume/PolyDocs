 In C++, operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one, two, or three operands, and then return a result. Operators are essential in C++ as they allow you to manipulate data and variables in various ways. Here, we will cover some of the most commonly used operators in C++.



Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations. The following table lists the arithmetic operators available in C++:



| Operator | Description           | Example       |

|----------|-----------------------|---------------|

| `+`      | Addition              | `a + b`       |

| `-`      | Subtraction           | `a - b`       |

| `*`      | Multiplication        | `a * b`       |

| `/`      | Division              | `a / b`       |

| `%`      | Modulus (remainder)   | `a % b`       |



Relational operators are used to compare two values. They return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) based on the comparison. Here are the relational operators in C++:



| Operator | Description           | Example       |

|----------|-----------------------|---------------|

| `==`     | Equal to              | `a == b`      |

| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `a != b`      |

| `>`      | Greater than          | `a > b`       |

| `<`      | Less than             | `a < b`       |

| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `a >= b`  |

| `<=`     | Less than or equal to | `a <= b`      |



Logical operators are used to perform logical operations. They are often used in control statements such as `if`, `while`, and `for` loops. The logical operators in C++ are:



| Operator | Description           | Example       |

|----------|-----------------------|---------------|

| `&&`     | Logical AND           | `a && b`      |

| `||`     | Logical OR            | `a || b`      |

| `!`      | Logical NOT           | `!a`          |



Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. The most basic assignment operator is `=`, but there are also compound assignment operators that combine an arithmetic operation with assignment. Here are some examples:



| Operator | Description           | Example       |

|----------|-----------------------|---------------|

| `=`      | Assign                | `a = b`       |

| `+=`     | Add and assign        | `a += b`      |

| `-=`     | Subtract and assign   | `a -= b`      |

| `*=`     | Multiply and assign   | `a *= b`      |

| `/=`     | Divide and assign     | `a /= b`      |

| `%=`     | Modulus and assign    | `a %= b`      |



Increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one. These operators are often used in loops. The increment and decrement operators in C++ are:



| Operator | Description           | Example       |

|----------|-----------------------|---------------|

| `++`     | Increment             | `++a` or `a++`|

| `--`     | Decrement             | `--a` or `a--`|



Operators are a fundamental part of C++ programming. Understanding how to use them effectively will allow you to write more efficient and readable code. Practice using these operators in different scenarios to become more comfortable with their functionality.
