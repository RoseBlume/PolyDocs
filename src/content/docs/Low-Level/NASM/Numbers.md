 =======================



In NASM assembly, numbers can be represented in various formats, such as decimal, hexadecimal, and binary. Here are some examples:



Decimal Numbers

---------------

To represent decimal numbers, simply write the number as it is. For example:



```asm

mov eax, 42

```



Hexadecimal Numbers

-------------------

To represent hexadecimal numbers, prefix the number with `0x`. For example:



```asm

mov ebx, 0x2A

```



Binary Numbers

--------------

To represent binary numbers, prefix the number with `0b`. For example:



```asm

mov ecx, 0b101010

```



You can perform arithmetic operations on these numbers using NASM assembly instructions.
